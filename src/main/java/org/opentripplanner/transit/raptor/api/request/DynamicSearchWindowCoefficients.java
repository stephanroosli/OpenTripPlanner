/**
 * The dynamic search window coefficients is used to calculate EDT(earliest-departure-time),
 * LAT(latest-arrival-time) and DW(raptor-search-window) request parameters using heuristics.
 * The heuristics perform a Raptor search (one-iteration) to find a trip witch we use to find a
 * lower bound for the travel duration time - "minTripTime". The heuristic search is used for
 * other purposes too, and is very fast.
 * <p>
 * At least EDT or LAT must be passed into Raptor to perform a Range Raptor search. If
 * unknown/missing the parameters(EDT, LAT, DW) is dynamically calculated. The dynamic
 * coefficients affect the performance and should be tuned to match the deployment.
 * <p>
 * The request parameters are calculated like this:
 * <pre>
 *     DW  = round_N(C + T * minTripTime)
 *     LAT = EDT + DW + minTripTime
 *     EDT = LAT - (DW + minTripTime)
 * </pre>
 * The {@code round_N(...)} method is will round the input to the closest multiplication of N.
 * <p>
 * There are 3 coefficients: {@link #c()}, {@link #t()} and {@link #n()}.
