 * RaptorWorker is fast, but FastRaptorWorker is knock-your-socks-off fast, and also more maintainable.

 * the travel times from the final transit stop of a trip out to the individual targets.

 * This class originated as a rewrite of our RAPTOR code that would use "thin workers", allowing computation by a

 * the way we do all analysis work. This system also accounts for pure-frequency routes by using Monte Carlo methods
 * (generating randomized schedules).
