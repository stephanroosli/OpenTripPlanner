/**
 * RaptorWorker is fast, but FastRaptorWorker is knock-your-socks-off fast, and also more maintainable.
 * It is also simpler, as it only focuses on the transit network; see the Propagater class for the methods that extend
 * the travel times from the final transit stop of a trip out to the individual targets.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm used herein is described in
 * <p>
 * Conway, Matthew Wigginton, Andrew Byrd, and Marco van der Linden. “Evidence-Based Transit and Land Use Sketch Planning
 * Using Interactive Accessibility Methods on Combined Schedule and Headway-Based Networks.” Transportation Research

 * <p>
 * There is currently no support for saving paths.
 * <p>
 * This class originated as a rewrite of our RAPTOR code that would use "thin workers", allowing computation by a
 * generic function-execution service like AWS Lambda. The gains in efficiency were significant enough that this is now
 * the way we do all analysis work. This system also accounts for pure-frequency routes by using Monte Carlo methods
 * (generating randomized schedules).
