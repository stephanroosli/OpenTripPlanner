 * and down, it can do so because the trips are ordered after the FIRST stop
 * boarding times. We also assume that trips do not pass each other; Hence
 * trips in service on a given day will be in order for all other stops too.
 *
 * The search uses to a binary search if the number of trip schedules is above a
 * given threshold. A linear search is slow when the number of schedules is very
 * large, let say more than 300 trip schedules.
